```bash

## Description
Barley's Brewery Database can search for breweries by city and return 100 breweries each in cards. 

The cards list the brewery type so you can decide if you want a more casual feel like a microbrewery or if you want more of a restaurant feel like a brewpub. 

The cards also list the street address so you can assess how close these are or if you're looking for something new, you can find one somewhere you've never been before!

Lastly, the cards will also have a "Save" button so you can save the one's you've been to & loved or the ones you want to go to!

### Search by city
Here in this search bar you can search for a list of breweries by city! So if you're visiting cities like Boston, San Francisco, or San Diego you can always find a brewery near you!

### Save Button
Save any breweries that you love by clicking the "Save" button on the card and they will populate at the bottom. These will even save between searches, so if you have favorites or want-to-gos in both Atlanta and Sacramento you can add both to your list!

## Roadmap
On our 2023 Roadmap, our team at Barley Dog Headquarters are looking to do some feature enhancements! 
- Directions to brewery
- Ability to save different kinds of lists
- The ability to see where the brewery is on a map
